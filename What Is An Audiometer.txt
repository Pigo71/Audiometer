An audiometer is a device that tests hearing. It produces a tone with a frequency and intensity set by the operator. To test hearing, the operator sets it to a frequency, starts it at the lowest intensity, and gradually raises the intensity until the listener indicates that the tone was heard. The frequency and intensity at which the tone was heard is recorded, and other frequencies are tested.
